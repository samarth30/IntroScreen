```
Splash Screen + Intro screen + Lottie Animations + SharedPrefrences
```

you can also choose different animations according to your demands for the app from this website https://lottiefiles.com/

```
just download the file and store it in the raw folder in the android studio and call the animation from there
```

I have implemented this dependency in the project but you can update this by changing the <b>version</b> from the official repository
https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android.git
```
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.airbnb.android:lottie: version'
}
```

I have includes shared prefrences in this and at each screen i have applied lottie animations

only one time the intro screen will appear after wards it will never appear and spash screen will appear


this is the older version yout can have it by changing to the first branch
